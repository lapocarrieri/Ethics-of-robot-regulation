# Ethics-of-robot-regulation
The Vestigial Heart is a very interesting book that discusses the role of robots in
order to reestablish emotions in people. It is set in a futuristic world where all
the people cannot live without their robots and everything needs the robotics help,
in this world, people lost their feelings and emotions. The character on which my
paper focuses is Silvana, a woman in love with the past that read a lot of books
from that period. The breakdown of the book is the decryogenization of Celia, a girl
of the 21st century that becomes the only person who has feelings, indeed is used
by Silvana to understand the past century with some clinical sessions, and is also
used by Leo, a bioengineer that is building a prosthesis for emotions. So these two
characters are trying to ripristinate human emotions from two different points of
view, during the book they interact together and discuss mixing up their idea until
Silvana understand that robot is the only last chance to retrieve emotions. This
paper discusses Silvanaâ€™s point of view on the available technology, its limits in its
use, the essential information to understand it, and my personal opinion about the
role of education and what knowledge is necessary to refuse to adopt a particular
technology. My ideas are very similar to the ones of Silvana since I think AIs
should be regulated and not overused and above all to understand and predict the
consequence of using AI.
